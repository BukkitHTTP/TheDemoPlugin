This is the demo plugin for BukkitHTTP. It is a simple plugin that allows you to router a request to a folder.  
Features demonstrated in this plugin:
- File serving
- Configuration
- Routing

PRs are NOT welcomed.  
This plugin is for demonstration purposes only.  
It needs to be kept simple and easy to understand, instead of being bug-free.
